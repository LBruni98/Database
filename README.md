# ERD and SQL table

#### ERD
##### What is an ERD?
An ERD or Entity Relationship Diagram is essentially a type of flowchart that is used to show how "Entities" relate together in a system. These diagrams are commonly associated to databases within software engineering, business information systems, education and research and are used to design or debug said databases.

The diagram above shows the various entities; Students, courses, departments and modules, and how they relate to each other in the database.
The way I created the database was through the site [Draw.io]. The site has many tools to help create numerious flowcharts of any kind as well as chart formatting, page settings and ability to link to your github account and Repo. The site is entirely free without having to sign up.

##### Game Heros and Enemies ERD

The diagram above shows the various entities; Enemies, Heroes, Skills and the Skills belonging to both heroes and Enemies. I created the diagram using the site [Draw.io], a site that allows the creation of charts. This site has many tools to help create numerious flowcharts of any kind as well as chart formatting, page settings and ability to link to your github account and Repo. The site is entirely free without having to sign up. Using this diagram, I was able to create a database using the entities in said diagram.
